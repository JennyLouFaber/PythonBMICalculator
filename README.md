# PythonBMICalculator
This project was my first complete project in Python.  It is a tutorial given by Alex the Analyst, and I was very excited when I was able to make it all work.
I didn't make very many changes in this project, as there weren't too many ways to customize it.
I am looking forward to doing another project.  I'm thinking about making one that involves food recipes.
